	"abstract": "This paper positions itself in an up-and-coming fields of human-information interaction and information design, set in a broader field of information management. By applying the latest approaches to design of human-centered information systems and Design Science Research Methodology, this paper examines problem-based information needs within a specific information space in a context of travel industry. The underlying goal of this paper is to move away from human-computer interaction, which has traditionally been concerned with the study of personal information management and information needs, and to improve understanding of theoretical background for designing human-centered communication and information systems. More specifically it looks at many-to-many online knowledge-sharing platforms, with a particular focus on information-seeking behavior within those platforms. On a more practical note, the results of the analysis are used to provide a set of guiding principles for designing such platforms in a specific context of travel and location-based information-seeking.",
